There are a lot of things in the real world that we can't represent in those default data types. For example, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.\n","\n","With classes and objects, we can create our own data types. For example, we want to model a student which is not a single string or a number. We can create a class for student. Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called **methods**, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.\n","\n","The properties that all Student objects must have are defined in a method called .\\_\\_init\\_\\_().
